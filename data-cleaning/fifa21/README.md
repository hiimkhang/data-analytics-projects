FIFA 21 Dataset Analysis
</h1>

This project focuses on analyzing the FIFA 21 dataset by performing data preprocessing and visualization. The goal is to gain insights into player positions and the impact of various skills on the wages of center backs (CB) and strikers (ST), as these two have the highest distributed among all positions.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing stage involves several steps to prepare the dataset for analysis:

- **Cleaning and Converting Field Values**: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing data, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistent values. Additionally, certain fields are converted to the appropriate data types to ensure accurate analysis.

- **Removing Redundant Features**: Redundant features that do not contribute significantly to the analysis or are highly correlated with other features are identified and removed. This simplifies the dataset and focuses the analysis on the most relevant variables.

- **Joining Related Features**: Related features are joined or combined to create new meaningful variables. This helps in exploring deeper relationships and enhancing the analysis with consolidated information.

## Visualization
The visualization component of this project aims to showcase the relationships and impacts of various variables on the wages of CB and ST players. The following visualizations are included:

- **Distribution of Player Positions**: This visualization provides an overview of the distribution of player positions in the dataset. It helps understand the frequency and proportion of different positions, highlighting the prominence of CB and ST positions in particular.

- **Correlation Heatmap and Bars**: The correlation heatmap displays the correlation coefficients between different skills and the wages of CB and ST players. It enables the identification of skills that have the most significant impact on player wages. The correlation bars further illustrate these relationships, visually indicating the strength and direction of the correlations.

- **Quantitative and Qualitative Variable Relationships**: Various relationships between quantitative and qualitative variables and player wages are explored. This includes analyzing the relationships between Value and Wage, Overall Rating and Wage, and International Reputation and Wage. These visualizations provide insights into how different factors contribute to the determination of player wages.
